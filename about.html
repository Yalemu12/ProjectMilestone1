        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>  Hello Everyone My name is Yonnas  Alemu and I attend KSU. Currently I am a sophmore majoring in Information Technology with a minor in Compputer Science. I am expected to graduate at around 2026 of May. With my after graduation plans is to work in tech at one of the big tech companies and possibly work in Data Analytics.</p>
        <p>  During school semesters I work in the student center at my univeristy part-time. During the summer I currently work at State-Farm as a Software Engineer Intern. This summer I will actually be going to their headquarters in Bloomington Illinois for onboarding.</p>
        <p>  My goals right now is to graduate with my bachelors and have a good paying job. I also have always wanted to be a content creator I'm making progress to start on that now. But hopefully in the future it scales up to be something great.</p>
